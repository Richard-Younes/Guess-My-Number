# Guess-My-Number
First project using Javascript to build a website like game.
In this project I learned the basics of DOM manipulation, as to create this game like website.
Its objective is to try and guess the random number generated which is between 1 and 20. 
For each guess you lose a score, your highscore will be saved, and the chosen guess will either be higher, lower or equal to the Winning number.
